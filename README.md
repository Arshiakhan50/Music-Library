# Music-Library
As part of my coursework for CPS209 (Computer Science 2), I implemented a Java-based music library application. This project effectively demonstrates key software engineering concepts.

The application involves reading a data store file using the Scanner library to populate a music catalog. Users can then interact with the library, selecting their preferred songs or audiobooks for playback.

This project adeptly integrates crucial programming principles. It utilizes hashmaps for efficient data organization, incorporates error management for robustness, and employs abstract classes, inheritance, and encapsulation for modular design and code reusability.

Furthermore, the application showcases polymorphism, adapting seamlessly to different audio content types. It also leverages Java Streams for efficient data processing.

Overall, this music library project succinctly showcases a mastery of diverse programming concepts acquired through CPS209, highlighting both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills.
